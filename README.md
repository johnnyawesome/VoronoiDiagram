# VoronoiDiagram

The famous Voronoi Diagram, coded in P5JS

## There are three variations of the code available!

### Voronoy Diagram

The Folder "VoronoyDiagram" contains a fast and efficient variation:

[I also wrote a blogpost about the Voronoy Diagram that explains things in depth.](https://breaksome.tech/coding-a-voronoi-diagram-in-p5js/)

### Voronoy Diagram Pixel Perfect

The Folder "VoronoyDiagramPixelPerfect" contains a Pixel-Perfect, but slow variation:

[There's a second blogpost about the Voronoy Diagram Pixel Perfect with some more background-information.](https://breaksome.tech/coding-the-voronoi-diagram-in-p5js-pixel-perfect/)

### Voronoy Diagram Cells

The Folder "VoronoyDiagramCells" contains a beautiful, animated cells-variation, which also requires more resources:
